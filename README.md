## Bypassing the Neo23x0 (Florian Roth) auditd Configuration Using the fexecve Systemcall

I have created a Proof of Concept (PoC) to demonstrate how can be leveraged to bypass the Neo23x0 auditd configuration.

This PoC highlights how attackers might avoid detection by relying on alternative syscalls that are often not properly monitored by standard audit configurations.
