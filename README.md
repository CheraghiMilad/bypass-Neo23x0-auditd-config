## Bypassing Neo23x0 Auditd Configuration on Linux Systems

This repository presents a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates various techniques for bypassing the Neo23x0 auditd configuration on Linux systems. It showcases how certain low-level methods can evade detection by auditd, revealing gaps in default security monitoring and highlighting the need for more robust auditing strategies.

## Purpose
The Neo23x0 auditd configuration is designed to detect and log critical security events. However, certain system-level operations may go unlogged due to limitations in the default audit rule set. This PoC aims to expose these weaknesses and provide insights into how attackers might exploit them to avoid detection, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive audit coverage.
